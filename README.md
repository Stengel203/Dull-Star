# Dull-Star
Dull Star is a web-based strategy game in which players control a giant space station which is the home to various other smaller spacecraft. It can build new facilities, enhance research, construct new spacecraft and various other things. Players can forge alliances, attack other players and harvest minerals to improve their spacecraft. The goal of the game is to destroy all other opponents. Other gamemodes later on will include a co-op vs AI which will feature a massive enemy space station which the users will have to destroy.

## Station
Every player starts off with a station which can be customized to their heart's content. It is a mobile (but slow) unit which can traverse through space in the predefined 1000x1000 grid. The spaceship can be improved through the use of minerals, metals and other resources found throughout the map. These can be obtained by mining asteroids, harvesting planets or salvaging destroyed enemy spaceships. 

The core idea of the space station is that it serves as the central hub of all activity. It can construct new spaceships in the shipyard, increase population through additional living quarters, build research labs to enhance research, produce energy through reactors/solar energy, etc. 

It can grow as big as a small moon (depending on the choices the player makes) allowing it to house bigger and better spacecraft and other features.

## Facilities
### Shipyard
The shipyard is the area where new spacecraft are built. Examples of these spacecraft are typical fighters, miners and eventually bigger ships like destroyers or dreadnaughts. Higher levels of shipyards will increase production time and allow you to create newer spacecraft.







## Military
Your military troops can operate in two ways. First, they can be sent from your space station to targets of choice. The second way is creating a fleet of spaceships which act as a second (or third, etc) base where they can operate from. This will leave your base fairly undefended though.
